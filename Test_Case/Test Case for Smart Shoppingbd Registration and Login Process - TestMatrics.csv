1. % no. of test cases executed: (No. of test cases executed/total no. of test cases written)*100=(23/23)*100=100%
2. % no. of test cases not executed: (No. of test cases not executed/total no. of test cases written)*100=(0/24)*100=0
3. % no. of test cases passed : (No. of test cases passed/total no. of test cases executed)*100=(22/24)*100=91.67%
4. % no. of test cases failed: (No. of test cases failed/total no. of test cases executed)*100=(1/24)*100=4.17%
5. % no. of test cases blocked: (No. of test cases blocked/total no. of test cases executed)*100
6. Defect Density: No. of defects found/size(no.of requirements)=1/2
7. Defect removal efficiency:Fixed defects/(fixed defects+missed defects)=1/(1+0)=1
8.Defect leakage:No.of defects found in UAT/No.of defects found in testing*100=1/1*100
9.Defects rejection ratio: (No. of defect rejected/Total no.of defect raised)*100=(0/1)*100
10.Defect age: Fixed date-reported date=
11.Customer satisfication= No. of compliments per period of time.
